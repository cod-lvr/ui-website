          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" class="content">
            <p>
              <em>Owls</em> are birds from the order Strigiformes, which
              includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds
              of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head,
              binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers
              adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern
              hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Owls</em> hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds,
              although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found
              in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some
              remote islands.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Owls </em> are divided into two families: the true (or
              typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family,
              Tytonidae.
            </p>
