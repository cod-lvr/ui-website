          <h2>what is owl?</h2>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" class="content">
            <p>
              <em>Owls</em> are birds from the order Strigiformes, which
              includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds
              of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head,
              binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers
              adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern
              hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Owls</em> hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds,
              although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found
              in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some
              remote islands.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Owls </em> are divided into two families: the true (or
              typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family,
              Tytonidae.

          <h2>Physical Characteristics of Owls</h2>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" class="content">
            <p>
              <em>Owls</em>have many physical characteristics that make them
              distinct from other birds. Understanding those physical
              differences can help birders more easily recognize when they see
              an owl, and these are the first clues necessary for owl
              identification.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <!--using data list to define types of Owls-->
              <dt>Facial Disk</dt>
              <!--datalist term-->
              <dd>
                <!--datalist description-->
                An owl's face is distinctly shaped with a disk-like structure
                that surrounds the bill and eyes. The bird can use its facial
                muscles to slightly alter the shape of this disk and funnel
                sound more efficiently to its ears, greatly amplifying its
                hearing. The exact shape and color of the facial disk is a great
                field mark for identifying owls.
              </dd>
              <dt>Forward Eyes</dt>
              <dd>
                Owls have forward-facing eyes that give them binocular vision
                with improved depth perception and the ability to judge
                distances.
              </dd>
              <dt>Ear Tufts</dt>
              <dd>
                are distinctive longer feathers on the side of the head that can
                look like ears or horns, though they are not associated with
                hearing in any way. Not all owls have ear tufts, but it is
                believed that the tufts can help with the birdâ€™s camouflage by
                breaking up its outline to blend in better with its environment.
                The position of the tufts can also be a form of communication
                between owls, especially mates.
              </dd>
              <dt>Keen Hearing</dt>
              <dd>
                While all birds have good senses, owls have especially acute
                hearing that can help them locate the small scuffling of prey
                from great distances even in poor light or complete darkness.
                Some owls have their ears placed asymmetrically on their heads,
                an arrangement that can help them triangulate prey position more
                quickly and accurately.
              </dd>
              <dt>Foot Structure</dt>
              <dd>
                Many owls have feathered feet to help with insulation and to
                serve as minor protection from the bites or scratches of
                captured prey. The feathers on the feet also work similar to
                whiskers and help the birds detect when prey is within their
                grasp. Owl toes are also unique, and the outermost forward toe
                can rotate to face the back to hold prey more efficiently.
